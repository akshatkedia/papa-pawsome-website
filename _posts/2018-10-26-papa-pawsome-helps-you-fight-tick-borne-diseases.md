Ticks are a pet parent’s worst enemy. They are small fleas, commonly known as ticks, and are parasites that latch onto dogs and feed on their blood causing constant irritation to your dog.

Ensuring your dog is not a target for fleas is the best way to avoid ticks in the future. There are many ways for this.

•Tick repellent sprays to put on your dog before they step outside.

• They are natural.

•They wear off quickly so must be applied before every walk.

•Topical insecticides can be used as a preventive measure as well as in case your dog has ticks

•They are chemical based because they are medicinal.

•They stay longer and need to be reapplied depending on the product, between 30 – 90 days

•An alternate solution is a dog tick collar, which is the easiest method.

•It doesn’t need to be changed regularly, once in 3 months is good to go.

•It prevents ticks and also kills ticks, if any, on the coat.

If your dog already has ticks, check his/her coat every day and use tick shampoo such as - **_PAPA PAWSOME_**’s 100% natural tick free **shampoo** to get rid of the ticks faster, along with the above-mentioned ways. You can also use **_PAPA PAWSOME_**’s aromatherapy **massage oils** because essential oils are natural tick repellents.

Make sure you consult a vet before using any products, for best-suited products for your dog and more suggestions.
