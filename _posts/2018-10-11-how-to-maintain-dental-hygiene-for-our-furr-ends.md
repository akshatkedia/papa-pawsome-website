Dental hygiene is very important in dogs because if not clean, other than bad breath, it can cause a build up of plaque and tartar which not only causes dental diseases, but of other organs too. So maintaining a good dental hygiene prevents your dog from many diseases of kidney or liver as well. Some dental issues that arise are, tooth decaying, gum disease called gingivitis which makes the gums bleed because of plaque build-up, tooth ache, etc. 

It is recommended to have a dental care regime with dogs as puppies, for them to get used to it, but if you think your adult dog needs a little care, you can start now, but be a little patient and keep treats handy to appease him/her.

 A simple way to care for your dog’s dental hygiene is to use a soft bristle tooth brush or a soft cloth, apply some pet toothpaste and clean their teeth. If this is not possible regularly, use mouth washes, drinking water additives or dental treats. Dry food also helps in scrubbing away the plaque. PAPA PAWSOME’s amazing mouth wash and water additive is 100% organic and is noted to have been loved by pets and recommended by their pet parents. 

 At a regular check up at the vet, get your dog’s teeth cleaned professionally because they do a thorough check up after giving your dog anaesthesia to determine if there is any issue and its solutions. These dental cleaning clear up all the plague or tartar and should be done mostly once a year or in six months, as per the vet recommends.
