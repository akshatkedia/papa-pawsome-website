Lhasa Apso is one of the most adorable dog breeds out there. Their long, beautiful double coat of hair is their recognising factor and it gives them a cute, royal look. But this hair isn’t easy to care for and pet parents have a proper grooming regime for this gorgeous breed.

Brushing is the most important part in a Lhasa Apso’s grooming session. A nice, smooth bristled brush with detangling spray can go a long way and are a great combination to keep this pooch’s hair shiny soft and of course, detangled. While brushing, remember to brush both the layers of hair, the upper coat and under coat. If you are too particular about how your pooch looks, you can also use a PAPA PAWSOME’s completely organic dog hair serum after brushing. Weekly brushing is regular enough to avoid tangles for Lhasa Apso’s lush mane.

Bathing needs special care to keep their coat shiny and soft. Choose a dog friendly shampoo which is organic such as the PAPA PAWSOME shampoo and conditioner, so that no chemical harm is caused to your lovely Lhasa pooch. You can also use conditioning sprays and creams to keep the hair soft and tangle free. The frequency of its bath can range from once in two weeks to once in six weeks, depending on how often your Lhasa goes out, and the hair length that you have maintained, but not too regularly because their skin can get dry an irritated. A good way to notice if it needs a bath is a faint doggy smell or if their hair appears oily or matted. Use proper techniques while bathing so as to not tangle the long, wet hair.

A regular trip to a groomer is advised because you can keep a check on their skin, hair and also get a haircut which is also important due to heat. The most common cut used on Lhasa Apso is the puppy cut, which is cutting their hair short, for cooling, and letting it grow back if you want.
