Unlike us, our pets don't need smartwatches to track their steps. However, they do need nourishment to their skin, paws and other sensitive areas. Much like us, our furry babies, get cracked heels and rough paws which sometime may bleed or worse even get infected!  
To keep healthy paws :

1\. Just like we wash our hands and legs after entering our humble abode, clean your pooch's paws, so that foreign objects like broken glass or pebbles or even ticks and fleas stuck between their toes will be removed and any immediate attention can be given if serious object like glass is stuck.

2\. HOT! HOT! HOT! Now, we don't realise that the earth is hot because we don't walk barefoot. However, our little babies do; and that is why it is necessary to keep their paws moisturised. Use **PAPA PAWSOME'**s paw cream- apply a thin layer after cleaning the paw to cure cracked and bleeding paws and also to help create a shield against the hot earth.

3\. Up and Down the rocky mountains- Just as we need to build up to a new exercise regimen, so do our dogs. Do not take them for a long walk across rocky terrain with carpet soft paws. Think walking barefoot across sharp rocks.

Use these beautiful tips to help keep your babies safe and healthy.Â
