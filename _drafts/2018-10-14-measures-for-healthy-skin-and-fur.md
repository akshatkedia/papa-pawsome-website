Maintaining your dog’s skin and coat healthy is an important task of pet parenting and important for your dog’s health as well. Apart from choosing the right products, we have to keep in mind other things too, such as –

Diet

Dogs need a particular set of nutrients that adds on to their shiny coat and skin. Consult a vet as to what food products are best for your pooch, and if you’re following a homemade diet, ask what nutrients need to be added. Be careful as to not give your dog food that you eat, especially sweets because they are very dangerous for their health as well as skin.

Bathing

Ask your vet how often your dog needs a bath, because it differs from breed to breed and outside activity as well. It could range from once in two weeks, to once in six weeks. Make sure you consult the doctor for a good shampoo as well, because it’s very important to use a good, dog friendly, organic shampoo that is chemical free and doesn’t harm your dog in any way, such as the PAPA PAWSOME organic shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for all breeds. 

Brushing

Regularly brushing your dog goes a long way in maintaining his overall hygiene. Brushing helps remove loose hair, as well the dander. After brushing  Even if your dog has short hair that don’t need regular brushing, try doing it as often as you can, as advised by the doctor to keep it healthy and shiny. You can also apply PAPA PAWSOME’s dog friendly hair serum, which is not silicon based and in fact, completely organic so it is beneficial for your dog’s shiny, healthy coat.

Massages
